Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Machine Learning

A complete machine learning–based Intrusion Detection System designed to predict whether a network/system event indicates an attack or normal behavior. This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, imbalance handling, EDA, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.


Project Description

This project focuses on building an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using multiple machine learning classifiers. The aim is to detect potential cyber-attacks by analyzing structured data containing system/network features.

Multiple ML algorithms are trained and compared, and the XGBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy, making it the best-performing model for predicting whether an attack has occurred.

The project covers the full ML pipeline, starting from dataset ingestion to final prediction and model saving.
